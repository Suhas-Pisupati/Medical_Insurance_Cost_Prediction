# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict medical insurance costs using a linear regression model. The application is built using Flask for the web interface and Keras for model handling. It takes user input for various factors and provides an estimate of insurance costs.

## Project Structure

- `MIP.py`: Contains the code for data preprocessing and model training.
- `app.py`: The main Flask application file that handles user requests and predictions.
- `index.html`: The HTML template for the user interface.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the HTML page.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
3. Install the required packages from `requirements.txt`.
4. Run the Flask application using `app.py`.

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
2. Enter the required information in the input fields.
3. Submit the form to get the predicted insurance cost.
